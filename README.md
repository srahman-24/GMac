## Description 

This software provides a hyperparameter-free, fast and efficient clustering framework for High dimensional data for limited samples (N << P). 

## Table of Contents 

- Microarray-data
     This folder contains all the post-processed 32 microarray datasets used to compare the clustering algorithms. 
    We downloaded the raw data from https://schlieplab.org/Static/Supplements/CompCancer/datasets.htm.  
     Some datasets, including Alizadeh-v1,v2,v3, Bittner, Garber, Lapointe-v1, Liang, Risinger, Singh-v1, Tomlins-v1, and West, were already present preprocessed and centered and were therefore not log-transformed further. For others, we took the logarithmic transformation, then standardized them by centering on the median and scaling by the standard deviation.
